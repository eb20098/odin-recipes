    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This pasta salad is nice and colorful, easy to make, and great for summer picnics or parties. The recipe was given to me by a dear friend many years ago, and I've been making it ever since!</p>
        <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pasta: This colorful, top-rated pasta salad starts with one pound of tri-colored spiral pasta.</li>
        <li>Dressing: Use a bottle of store-bought Italian-style dressing or, if you want to go the extra mile, <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/14325/creamy-italian-dressing-i/" rel="noreferrer">make your own at home.</a></li>
        <li>Seasoning mix: Salad seasoning mix lends tons of savory flavor.</li>
        <li>Vegetables: You will need cherry tomatoes, three bell peppers (green, yellow, and red), and a can of black olives.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 to 12 minutes; rinse under cold water and drain.</li>
        <li>Whisk Italian dressing and salad spice mix together until smooth. Combine pasta, tomatoes, bell peppers, and olives in a salad bowl.</li>
        <li>Pour dressing over salad and toss to coat.</li>
        <li> For the best flavor, refrigerate the pasta salad for 8 hours to overnight.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
